It was a simple picture of a witch on a broom. The picture made me imagine the character. I imagined that a young girl like my daughter was flying over skyscrapers in New York. The names of the characters are also essential. When I was young, I didn’t like school. However, my teacher remembered my given name and called me “Eiko chan” one day. I felt very happy. So when I write stories, I think carefully about the names of the characters. Once I named the witch “Kiki”, I felt that she was next to me. She whispered, “Let’s fly together.”' },

The waves then break these plastics into particles called “microplastics.” Also, microbeads used in health and beauty products come into the ocean. Next, I’ll talk about why microplastics are a problem. The main reason is related to the food chain. Birds and fish eat microplastics by mistake. In one study, microplastics were found in 40% of fish caught near Japan. Scientists worry that negative effects on human health might show up someday. Now, I’ll talk about actions against microplastics. Many actions are taken at the governmental and non-governmental levels. In the EU, a law bans the use of plastics for some disposable products. In Japan, major companies have already ended the use of microbeads. Let me conclude with what we can do. I recommend the 4Rs: refuse, reduce, reuse, and recycle. For example, bring your own bag when you go shopping. Put plastics in the recycle bin when you throw them away. Your small actions will lead to a big change someday.' },

This trend is called fast fashion. It may be attractive to consumers, but there are also negative aspects. Have you ever thought about the reasons for the low prices of fast fashion? Let me give you an example. In Bangladesh, workers in jeans factories are mostly women and children. They work over 15 hours a day, but their monthly salary is only about 9,000 yen. In this way, fast fashion companies can keep the cost of production to a minimum. Do we have any solution to this problem? Actually, some consumers have been raising their voices against the situation. Recently some major companies began to produce clothes in ethical ways. They try to keep standard working hours and pay proper wages to factory workers. Finally, we’d like to conclude by introducing something we can do. Let’s be ethical consumers. In other words, when you buy clothes, consider how they are made. I strongly believe that good clothes bring happiness to both consumers and producers. Thank you.' },
